# Quick Bookmarks:

This Add-on allows you quick access to select bookmarks from the context menu (right click menu).

## How to use

Once installed, right click on any webpage to open up the context menu.  The last item in the context menu will be "Quick Bookmarks."  Hovering over that open will bring up a submenu that will allow the user to add the current page to the Quick Bookmarks submenu, or clicking on any of the bookmark titles will open that page in a new tab.

To delete or edit a quick bookmark, open the main bookmarks menu and there will be a folder titled "Quick Bookmarks."  All of the quick bookmark items can be edited or deleted from this folder.
